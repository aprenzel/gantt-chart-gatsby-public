# Build Interactive Gantt Charts with Airtable, Gatsby & React

With Gatsby it is very easy to integrate different data sources into one application. In this article, we develop a task management tool whose data is fetched from Airtable. As frontend technology we use React with a hybrid rendering strategy.

It's a common scenario: you want to develop an app that connects to data from a spreadsheet application or some other data source. In this article, I will show you how to implement an application of this type with the framework Gatsby. In our example application, tasks are imported from an Airtable workspace and visualised as a Gantt Chart. The user can move the tasks by drag and drop, after that all changes are synchronised with Airtable. You can use the project as a template for all kinds of scheduling apps.
